# growing_circle_js ðŸŽˆ

This is a simple page in which by means of class, conditional and event changes we get our circle to change color and size, the color is progressive, red, green, yellow, and the size increases by 10px until it reaches the size of 420px, which is reset.

I hope you like it!
